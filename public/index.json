[{"content":"Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It\u0026rsquo;s a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn from data and improve their performance over time.\nKey Concepts # Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on labeled data. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data and must find patterns on its own. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties. In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll dive into each of these areas and explore some common algorithms used today.\n","date":"20 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/machine-learning-basics/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"[TEST] The Basics of Machine Learning","type":"blog"},{"content":"Welcome to my blog!
