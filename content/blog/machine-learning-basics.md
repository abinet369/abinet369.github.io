Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It's a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn from data and improve their performance over time.

## Key Concepts

- **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data and must find patterns on its own.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

In this post, we'll dive into each of these areas and explore some common algorithms used today.
