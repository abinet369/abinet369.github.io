In this project, I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize global temperature trends over the last century. 

## Features

- **Interactive Maps**: Explore temperature changes across different regions.
- **Dynamic Charts**: Filter data by year, country, or specific climate indicators.
- **Data Insights**: Automated summaries highlighting significant trends.

Built using Python, Pandas, and Streamlit, this dashboard demonstrates the power of visual storytelling with data.
